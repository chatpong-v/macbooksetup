**Installation steps below assume that you are have Admin Access currently enabled**

---
## Xcode

---
## Self Service Installations

If not yet already installed on your Macbook, you can install the following apps:

  * Microsoft Office
  * Chrome

## Post XCode install

### Install XCode

Check if the full Xcode package is already installed:

`$ xcode-select -p`

If you see:

the full Xcode package is already installed. Otherwise:

`xcode-select --install`

You should see the pop up below on your screen. Click Install when it appears.

Once the software is installed, click Done. 

Before you go to the next step, verify that youâ€™ve successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools:

`$ xcode-select -p`

You should see:

`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`

Just to be certain, verify that gcc is installed:

``$ gcc --version``

If all went well, you should see the GCC version in the output. 

It will show something like this:

```

```bash
# tools
brew install bash
brew install watch
brew install jq

2. [Change the default shell via the terminal gui with the literal path of your new bash](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193411/update-bash-to-version-4-0-on-osx)

after following above instructions, you can conform your default shell is upgraded to Bash v5+

## Git

>  Tell Git who you are

git config --global core.autocrlf = true
```

> (Optional)To push code to your GitHub repositories, we're going to use the recommended HTTPS method (versus SSH). So you don't have to type your username and password everytime, let's enable Git password caching:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

## iTerm2

To install iTerm2, from [http://iterm2.com/](http://iterm2.com/)

#### iTerm2 setup for day-to-day use 
1. enable iterm2 Session [Restoration]( https://iterm2.com/documentation-restoration.html)

> in iTerm2
2. split screen horizontally
3. go to the bottom screen and split it vertically

I was using top screen for the work with yaml files and kubectl.

Left bottom screen was running:

    watch kubectl get pods

Right bottom screen was running:

    watch "kubectl get events --sort-by='{.lastTimestamp}' | tail -6"

With such setup it was easy to observe in real time how my pods are being created.


#### Add some color to your terminal


In **iTerm > Preferences...**, under the tab **Profiles**, section **Text**, change both fonts to **Consolas 13pt**.

Go to [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), scroll down, download, and unzip solarized.

Afterwards, in **iTerm2 Preferences**, under **Profiles** and **Colors**, go to **Load Presets > Import**, find and open the two **.itermcolors** files we downloaded and unzipped.

Go back to **Load Presets** and select **Solarized Dark** to activate it.
